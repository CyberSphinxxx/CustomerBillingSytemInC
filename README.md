A simple customer billing system using C programming language

This is a Performance Innovative Task (Final)
in Computer Programming 1 Subject in USTP

1. Accounts can be added to the program at any time and it can hold `any number of accounts`.
2. The programming of simple calculations such as calculation of `due amount`, `balance` `etc`. have been embedded in the code of this project.
3. The system also allows us to search an account by two ways, either by `name of the customer` or by the `number of customer`.
4. The due amount to be paid is shown as `negative balance`.
5. If you have nothing to do with the program, you can directly `exit` from the main menu.
